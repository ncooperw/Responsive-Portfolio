        <p>My coding career began as an accident. It was 1999, I was a scared young adult about to graduate from college with
          a degree in Psychology. During my last semester of college, I took a course in Teaching BioPsychology and my professor
          decided that the teaching focus of the course was going to be through an online learning platform. For my final
          project, I built an interactive web page for teaching about how the nose worked in tandem with the brain to give
          us a sense of smell. This was my first interaction with building anything on the internet and frankly,I still used
          dial-up at home. Little did I know that my future would take me in a roundabout way to a career of coding.</p>

          <p>I am presently a beginner at coding. I am extremely green and I believe this gives me an advantage. I am flexible,
            eager to learn, and not afraid to make mistakes; all excellent qualities of a web developer. This portfolio contains
            the steps along my journey.</p>
